            How Muslim Directory was born and our journey so far

              Muslim Directory was founded in 2023 by a group of Muslims who experienced firsthand the difficulty of finding halal restaurants, Muslim-owned businesses, and mosques when traveling or moving to new areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              We noticed that while there were some resources available, there wasn't a comprehensive, user-friendly platform dedicated to connecting the Muslim community with the services they need. We saw an opportunity to create something that would truly serve our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting with just a few hundred listings in major cities, we've grown to include thousands of businesses and mosques across multiple countries. Our team has expanded from a small group of passionate founders to a diverse team of developers, content creators, and community managers all working together to serve the Muslim ummah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Muslim Directory is accessed by thousands of Muslims daily, helping them find everything from halal restaurants and grocery stores to Islamic schools, healthcare providers, and professional services that align with their values.
            </p>
            <p>
              We continue to grow and improve our platform based on feedback from our community, always keeping our mission at the forefront: to connect Muslims with the resources they need to thrive in their daily lives.
